    	<p>The Poliarts group was founded in 2016 set against the backdrop of the presidential campaign. Concerned citizens with speci c knowledge of events regarding then candidate Donald Trump were anxious with the possiblity of his winning the election and wanted to make sure that thier information, that would later become infamous, could share their information in safty. This site offers them that ability. Hacktivists and Poitical aides can share their information and the artists can use that information to share that information in a way that accentuates its social impact.</p>

		<p>We encourage the sharing of information and actively seek membership of like minded citizens able to contribute their talents towards sustaining social critique and truth.</p>
